## add server-side functionality
- Using a tool called [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as server
- Using the <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">axios</a> library instead for communitation between the browser and server. It functions like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch">fetch</a>, but is somewhat more pleasant to use
- Effect hooks are precisely the right tool to use when fetching data from a server
